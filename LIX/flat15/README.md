This design is compatible with the automatic sample exchanger robot at NSLS-II LIX beamline. Place the frame-like "transparency" piece on top of the aluminum base plate, then place the sample strip on top. The notch should be placed toward the door when mounted on the beamline (notch is close to the handle).
