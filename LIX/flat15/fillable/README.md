Fillable cells: users bring solutions in microcentrifuge tubes, along with assembled cell strips. At the beamline, the following workflow is executed:
- Mount the empty strips on aluminum brackets, with 1mm spacer bracket in-between.
- Place the empty strips on the robot parking area, ~8 at a time.
- Measure empty cells.
- Fill the strips with samples, then place back on the robot parking area
- Measure filled cells, and perform empty subtraction.
- Subtract corresponding buffer.
A typical strip measurement with 24 frames, 1s / frame exposure takes about 11-12 minutes. This means the sample throughput is ~1 min / cell. The downside is the halved throughput and possible contamination if cells are not kept clean.
