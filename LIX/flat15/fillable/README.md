Fillable cells: users bring solutions in microcentrifuge tubes, along with assembled cell strips. 

tape_brookhaven_fillable.svg: the red lines need to be cut at lower power to cut only two layers out of 3 (smooth protective layer + adhesive layer). Cut the red lines first with ~1mm lead-in / lead-out, then cut the black lines.

Assembly: remove the smooth protective layer and attach the tape to the acrylic strip on both sides. Removal of the other protective layer should remove the tab-like adhesives above the u-shaped wells.

At the beamline, the following workflow is executed:
- Mount the empty strips on aluminum brackets, with 1mm spacer bracket in-between.
- Place the empty strips on the robot parking area, ~8 at a time.
- Measure empty cells.
- Fill the strips with samples, then place back on the robot parking area
- Measure filled cells, and perform empty subtraction.
- Subtract corresponding buffer.
A typical strip measurement with 24 frames, 1s / frame exposure takes about 11-12 minutes. This means the sample throughput is ~1 min / cell. The downside is the halved throughput and possible contamination if cells are not kept clean.
