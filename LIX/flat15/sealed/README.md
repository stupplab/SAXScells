**File description**

- strip_brookhaven.svg: 2D vector file for the main compartment for flat15 cells. This should be laser-cut out of cast acrylic plates with known thickness. Area per cell = 17.034 mm^2.
- tape_brookhaven.svg: 2D vector file for the double adhesive tape for flat15 cells. This should be laser-cut applied to both sides of the main compartment strip.

*Experimental*
- stripT_brookhaven.svg and tapeT_brookhaven.svg: T-shaped cell to reduce volume and focus on sedimented materials. May not work on 2mm thick spacers due to the beam hitting the PMMA walls. The bottom of the cell is at the same height, the top is 1mm higher. Tape is centered against the T. Area per cell = 14.009 mm^2.
