# Capillary sorting tip
To fit Charles Supper 1.5 mm capillaries into the DND-CAT multicapillary heater holders, do the following:
## Things to prepare
- Fisherbrand SureOne micropipette tips, 200uL universal fit, 02-707-422
- Ruler
- Fresh razor blade
- Silicone rubber mat
- Marker
## Making the capillary sorter
Using the fresh razor blade, cut the pipette tip at the following length:
- short: 40.5 mm
- long: 41 mm
You can make a series of capillary sorters by cutting them 0.5 mm apart, from 39 mm down to 44 mm.
## Sorting capillaries
Using the capillary sorter you made, you are now passing each capillary through. Look for straight capillaries (no bulging, fluting) that passes the short sorter, but stops with the long sorter. You can group capillaries in numbers.
