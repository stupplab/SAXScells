# SAXScells

This is a repository hosting the CAD files for the liquid sandwich cells used by Stupp lab at NSLS-II 16-ID LIX, APS 5-ID-D DND-CAT and other beamlines. These are mostly meant for aqueous solutions.

## List of Materials

- 3M 9474LE 300LSE double-adhesive sheet (available at Amazon)
- CLAREX PMMA sheet (Precision cast acrylics, available from Astra Products)
- Alkaline-free ultrathin glass, 10mm x 100mm for strips and 100mm x 100mm for plates
  - 30um for minimum background (only available in 100mm x 100mm): we have tested Schott AF32eco for this.
  - 50 or 100um for typical samples: we have tested Schott AF32eco, but others have used Corning Willow glass. We will be testing Nippon Electric Glass G-leaf soon.
- Marble stone for pressing: we used the cheese slicer board from Amazon without handle/wire.

- Texwipe TX3211
- Scotch tape
- Pipettes (30-40uL), air-displacement or positive displacement
- Wide-bore pipette tips or positive displacement pistons

The patterns are laser cut on:
- tape: 3M 9474LE 300LSE
- transparency: 1 mm CLAREX PMMA sheet
- strip / plate: 1.5-2 mm CLAREX PMMA sheet (this depends on path length requirements)

SOP.txt shows the procedure for filling 2mm "strip" cells.
