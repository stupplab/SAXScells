# SAXScells

This is a repository hosting the CAD files for the liquid sandwich cells used at NSLS-II 16-ID LIX, APS 5-ID-D DND-CAT and other beamlines. 

The patterns are cut on:
- tape: 3M 9474LE 300LSE
- transparency: 1 mm CLAREX PMMA sheet
- strip / plate: 1.5-2 mm CLAREX PMMA sheet (this depends on path length requirements)
